          → 1. To make the meringues, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>
          → 2. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they form soft peaks.<br>
          → 3. Gradually add the sugar, vanilla extract, and salt, and continue beating until the egg whites form stiff, glossy peaks.<br>
          → 4. Using a spoon or a piping bag, drop or pipe the meringue mixture into 6-8 small mounds onto the prepared baking sheet.<br>
